    "In this assignment we will revisit an old friend, the traveling salesman problem (TSP).  This week you will implement a heuristic for the TSP, rather than an exact algorithm, and as a result will be able to handle much larger problem sizes.  Here is a data file describing a TSP instance (original source: http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/bm33708.tsp).\n",

For example, if both the third and fifth cities have the same distance from the first city (and are closer than any other city), then the tour should begin by going from the first city to the third city.\n",
